<p >Barcelona's lead gave Liverpool little chance, but Divock Origi and Georginio Wijnaldum had other ideas as the Reds reached the final.
Doubles from Divock Origi and substitute Georginio Wijnaldum fired Liverpool into their second consecutive Champions League final as Barcelona collapsed to an improbable 4-0 humiliation at Anfield.

Facing a daunting 3-0 deficit after last week's first leg, Origi made light of Mohamed Salah and Roberto Firmino's absence from the Liverpool forward line by poaching a seventh-minute opener on Tuesday.

Jurgen Klopp's side kept the contest at a pace frenetic enough that Barcelona were rarely allowed to settle and Wijnaldum's quickfire brace before the hour had the locals in raptures.<br>

It was a night for unlikely heroes and Trent Alexander-Arnold's quickly taken corner allowed Origi to smash high into the net 11 minutes from time – inflicting a humbling upon LaLiga champions Barca and the great Lionel Messi even more punishing than their surrender at Roma in last season's quarter-final.

Liverpool's remarkable 4-3 aggregate triumph means a June 1 final against Ajax or Tottenham - and the chance to right the wrongs of last season's fall to Real Madrid at the last hurdle - awaits.</p>
